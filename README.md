# Parallel End-to-End RNA-seq Pipeline for Read Generation

This repository is dedicated to a highly efficient, parallel RNA-seq pipeline designed for bioinformaticians and genomic researchers. Leveraging the power of parallel computing, it provides an end-to-end solution for processing RNA-seq data from raw reads to feature counting, ensuring swift and reproducible results across large datasets.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized for multi-core environments to enhance throughput and reduce processing times.
- **End-to-End Workflow**: From quality control and read trimming to alignment and feature counting, all within a single, streamlined pipeline.
- **Conda Environment Setup**: Easy setup of a bioinformatics environment with essential tools pre-configured.
- **Reproducibility and Scalability**: Designed to ensure that your analysis is reproducible and scalable, accommodating datasets of various sizes.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- A system with Miniconda or Anaconda installed.
- Access to a multi-core computing environment.
- Basic knowledge of RNA-seq data analysis and command-line operations.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qnmateen/parallel-rna-seq-pipeline.git
   cd parallel-rna-seq-pipeline

chmod +x setup_rnaseq_tools_latest.sh


2. **Create and Activate the Conda Environment**:

   Set up the environment and install all necessary tools with:

   ```bash
   bash setup_rnaseq_tools_latest.sh
   ```

   Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate rnaseq-tools
   ```




### Running the Pipeline

To launch the parallel RNA-seq analysis, ensure your data and script paths are correctly set, then execute:

```bash
bash rna_seq_pipeline.sh
```


## Contents

- `setup_rnaseq_tools_latest.sh`: Prepares a Conda environment with the latest bioinformatics tools for RNA-seq analysis.
- `rna_seq_pipeline.sh`: Executes the parallel RNA-seq pipeline, covering all steps from quality control to read generation.
